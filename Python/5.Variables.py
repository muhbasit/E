#Variables or Data Type
#The data stored in memory can be of many types. 
#For example, a person's age is stored as a numeric 
#value and his or her address is stored as alphanumeric 
#characters. Python has various standard data types that 
#are used to define the operations possible on them and 
#the storage method for each of them.
#Python has five standard data types âˆ’
#Numbers
#String
#List
#Tuple
#Dictionary
