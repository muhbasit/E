## Machine Learning 
The field of study that gives computers the ability to 
without being explicitly programmed. 

Machine Learning is making the computer learn from studying data and statistics.
Machine Learning is a step into the direction of artificial intelligence (AI).
Machine Learning is a program that analyses data and learns to predict the outcome.

The deep learning revolution started around 2010.
Since then, Deep Learning has solved many "unsolvable" problems.
The deep learning revolution was not started by a single discovery. It more or less happened when several needed factors were ready:
Computers were fast enough
Computer storage was big enough
Better training methods were invented
Better tuning methods were invented

## Example 
Self Driving Car 
House Price Prediction 
Text Recognition 
Speech Recognition 
Face Detection 
Robotics, etc.
